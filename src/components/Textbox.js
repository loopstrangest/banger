    10: "Good luck hotshot. I wonder what your approach is to finding these rules. Methodical? Random? A mix of both? In any case, things like this which generate so-called aha moments are so satisfying to me. I hope you feel the same exact way.",
    11: "What's my woo stack? I THINK THOUGHTS. I'm serious, do you know how powerful thoughts are? Every constructed object was initially a thought in someone's mind. Everything you've ever sought, it all began as a thought. It is in your interest to have high-quality thoughts.",
    12: "I'm writing these off the cuff at this point, but they live here forever. Wow, there's a cardinal outside my window and it is gorgeous, the jittering red hopping among the green, pecking at the branches. The splendor of natural beauty.",
    13: "Let's turn up the heat some for the last four levels. From here to the end, the level's rule is applied to every unique pair of sequential words. If a message is 'one two three', then 'one two' will be checked, as well as 'two three', but not 'one three'. I hope that makes sense.",
    14: "It's about the unique pairs now! Like truth / beauty. Or being / doing. Oh I just figured out a fun rule! It's devious and tricky! But it can't be too obscure. There's a balance to strike.",
    15: "Part of me wants to share something electric here, like a reward for you persistent few beyond the gameplay itself. Here it is: my creative efforts are an expression of love.",
    16: "And now, the final level! This game took me to some interesting places, I hope it did the same for you. Banger dances with the aha moment, and I hope you've had a few. May you be well. May you be happy. May you be at peace.",
